## Homework 1: ER Diagram using ERwin Data Modeler
This homework focuses on visualizing and designing a database structure through diagrams. The assignment is divided into two parts:

- Part 1: Creation of a high-level database diagram.
- Part 2: Design of a detailed ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram using ERwin Data Modeler.

**Files included:**
- [CIS552-HW1_Part1](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-1/CIS552-HW1_Part1.pdf) – This file contains basic pen and paper diagram of entities such as Students, Courses, and Enrollments, with basic relationships like "Students enroll in Courses".
- [CIS552-HW1_Part2](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-1/CIS552-HW1_Part2.pdf) – The file contains ERwin diagram to show the detailed structure of entities such as Students, Courses, and Enrollments with defined attributes like student_id, course_id, etc.

## Homework 2: SQL Queries and Functions using MS SQL Server 2017
This homework involves writing SQL queries to perform common operations like joins, filtering, and using aggregate functions. 

**Files included:**
- [CIS552-HW2.pdf](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-2/CIS552-HW2.pdf) – A detailed document explaining the SQL queries created for performing various joins.
- [company-data]() – Data file containing employee details.

## Homework 4: Performance Tuning of Queries Using Indexes
This homework focuses on optimizing database performance by creating non-clustered indexes and writing efficient SQL queries. The tasks include analyzing query execution plans, creating indexes, and comparing the performance of optimized and unoptimized queries.

**Files included:**
- [CIS552-HW4](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-4/CIS552-HW4.pdf) – A detailed document detailing the creation of a database, table generation, data insertion, performance tuning using indexes, and query optimization.

## Homework 5: Setting Up and Managing an Azure SQL Database
This homework focuses on creating and managing an Azure SQL Database. The tasks include setting up an Azure SQL server, connecting it to a local SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), deploying a local database to the cloud, and performing queries directly in the Azure environment.

**Files included:**
- [CIS552-HW5](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-5/CIS552-HW5.pdf) – A detailed report of the steps taken to create and manage the Azure SQL Database, including server configuration, database deployment, and query execution.

---

## Homework 6: Managing NoSQL Data with Azure Cosmos DB
This homework focused on setting up and managing NoSQL data using Azure Cosmos DB. The tasks included creating a Cosmos DB account, adding and managing data in a container, and executing queries to filter and organize data effectively.

**Files included:**
- [CIS552-HW6](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-6/CIS552-HW6.pdf) – A detailed documentation of the Cosmos DB setup, container creation, and query execution.

## Homework 8: Neo4j Graph Database and Cypher Query Language
This homework involved using Neo4j, a graph database platform, setting up an account in Neo4j Aura, creating a database instance, populating data, and querying the data using Cypher Query Language (CQL). This process involved working with nodes and relationships to model a graph and executing various queries to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.

**Files included:**
- [CIS552-HW8](https://github.com/yashikapatil27/CIS552-Database-Design/blob/main/HW-8/CIS552-HW8.pdf) – A detailed document describing the process of setting up the database instance, executing CREATE commands, and performing Cypher queries within the Neo4j environment.
